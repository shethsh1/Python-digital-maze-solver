class Map:
    """
    This class is used to store the image in memory. It has the following fields:

    - fileName : Name of the image opened

    - img : The image object (used to output)

    - pixels : The 2D array containing pixel data. You will be using this for weights. 
                Each element is a 3-tuple representing the (R,G,B) values. Each of these 
                is an integer between 0 and 255.

                For example, if the pixel at (5,3) is Red,
                  pixels[(5,3)] = (255,0,0)

                Or, other notation you should be familiar with:
                  pixels[5][3][0] = 255   # Red
                  pixels[5][3][2] = 0     # Blue
                  pixels[5][3][3] = 0     # Green

    - sx, sy : The x and y dimensions of the image. Remember that the top left pixel (start) 
               is at (0,0). x increases as you go right, and y increases as you go down. The 
               bottom right pixel (target) is located at (sx-1, sy-1)

    - path : Initialized to be an empty array, but you need to add in the pixels along the 
             leastenergy path in here to have it output correctly. Each element in this should 
             be a tuple of (x,y) coordinates in order of the path you have found.

             For example:
             path = [(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), ... , (sx-1, sy-1)]

             Means your path found starts at (0,0), then goes to (0,1), then to (1,1), etc.
