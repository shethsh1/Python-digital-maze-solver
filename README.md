# Digital-Maze-Solver

Python solver that solves digital mazes by using the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. 

For example:

Using this digital maze on this program

<img src="./images/maze.jpg" align="left" alt="drawing" width="250" height="250" />

You would get

<img src="./images/Path-maze.jpg" align="left" alt="drawing" width="250" height="250" />
